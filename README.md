# Password-Generator
My first project, where I created a password generator. I wanted to recieve input from the user regarding both password length, whether they wanted special characters, and if so, how many. The updated version works for all cases AFAIK. I also created a GUI for the password generator, which I have also included with the icon file. I utilized pyinstaller to create a .exe as well.
